# This file is in YAML format.  You must ensure that the punctuation
# and whitespace is preserved.  Also, beware of ':' and quotation mark
# characters: these have meaning in YAML and so must be "escaped" by
# enclosing the entire field in (single) quotation marks, or using the multi-line string formatting characters ('|' for preserving newlines, '>' for folding newlines).
# See the YAML specification  (https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) or the wikipedia page about YAML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
# Also, Educative has a nice YAML tutorial (https://www.educative.io/blog/yaml-tutorial) that gives a nice rationale for learning YAML.
