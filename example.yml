  "Quick Jolt" Self-service coffee dispensing machine.

# Write your assessment of the rivalry between existing competitors.
competitor_rivalry: >
 Quick-jolt is a niche product with no direct competition (yet).  So
 the "competition" is conventional coffee bars such as Cafe Rore.  The
 trade-off is range and customisability vs. convenience: do I want to
 wait on queue so I can have something not available from Quick-jolt,
 or a customized version, or can I live with what will be a limited
 selection from Quick-jolt?

# Write your assessment of the threat of new entrants.
new_entrant_threat: >
 There is a threat that Aramark might install their own version of
 Quick Jolt. Otherwise, there are limited locations where new entrants
 might penetrate.

# Write your assessment of the threat of substitute products or services.
substitute_threat: >
 Quick-jolt is itself a substitute *service*: although the product
 (coffee) is the same as what is available from Cafe Rore or
 Starbucks, the method of sale is radically different.

 A possible substitute would be a an app that allows customers to
 place orders in advance, to be picked up later.  It's not clear this
 would be a viable substitute during busy periods, as customers would
 need to order well in advance to ensure their order is ready at the
 desired time, which means the coffee may not be hot.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of customers.  
customer_power: >
 Customers have several options on-campus, so they can "vote with
 their feet" if they are not satisfied.

 On the other hand, there many customers, so no individual customer
 has much bargaining power; suppliers and competition dictate the
 price.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of suppliers.
supplier_power: >
 There a limited number of manufacturers who sell turn-key solutions
 for unattended coffee dispensing with integrated payment systems, and
 many more products for self-service coffee dispensing that would
 require an add-on payment system.

 So, with an add-on payment system, switching vendors involves the
 cost of a new machine, plus installation.

# Write your conclusion regarding the appropriate competitive strategy to pursue, based on
# your assessments above.
competitive_strategy: >
 For a new company to enter the market via *cost leadership*, it would
 need to have a sufficient labor cost saving to allow substantially
 lower prices.  Also, it might be possible for a new company to
 partner with a large national or multinational company for branding
 rights: the company would pay a fee to have its brand on the vending
 machine.  This could offset revenue lost due to lower prices.

 In any case, a new company would *differentiate* its product by the delivery mode.
 
 Finally, this product occupies a *niche* market for limited selection
 of coffee drinks available on-demand (and after hours) via self-service.
